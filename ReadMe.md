# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster
This repo is the practice run where the author learns to implement machine learning model by solving the challenge provided in the Kaggle Competition.

## Challenge
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most famous shiprwreck.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately there was not enough lifeboats on the ship, resulting in killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew members.

Although there was some element of luck was present in surviving, it seems some of the people were more likely to survive such as women, children and upper class people.

Challenge is to build a predictive model to answer the question, "What sorts of people were more likely to survive than others?".
